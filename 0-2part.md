## The Basic Definitions

**What is a conceptual Graph?**

**Definition 1** (Conceptual Graph). A conceptual graph G consist of $G=(P(G), V(G); \partial_G:P(G) \rightarrow V(G)\times V(G), \iota_G: V(G) \hookrightarrow P(G) )$ where the part set $P(G)$ is the set of vertices V(G) join with the sets of edges of the graph $G$. The set $V(G) \times V(G)$ is the set of unordered pairs of vertices of $G$, $\delta_G$ is the incidence map and $\iota_G$ is the inclusion map of the vertex set into the part set.
